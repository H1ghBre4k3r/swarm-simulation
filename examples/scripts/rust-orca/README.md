# ORCA (in Rust)

This is my ORCA implementation in Rust.

### Requirements

You need to have Rust installed. The usual way is via [rustup](https://rustup.rs). Furthermore, `make` is more or less required.

### Compilation

To compile the rust implementation of ORCA, you can run:

```sh
$ make
```

#### Without make

If you do not have `make` installed on your system, you can compile ORCA without make. Simply run:

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```
